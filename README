Total five programs:
bargen1_edit_distance
bargen1_edit_distance_random

bargen2_Hamming
bargen2_Hamming_random

balancer

two bargen1 using editdistance
two bargen2 using hamming distance
In each set, it has an alternative executables with suffix random so it can randomly choose a start position

balancer is a program to print barcodes list in order with ACGT evenly distributed over the barcode list 
which produce by either bargen1 or bargen2

example:
./bargen2_Hamming 3 8 >barlen8_mismatch3.txt
generate 8 bases, using 3 mismatches with strict rule 2 (default)
or 
./bargen2_Hamming 3 8 1 >barlen8_mismatch3.txt
with strict rule 1 

./balancer barlen8_mismatch3.txt >barlen8_mismatch3.balanced.txt 

rebalance the barcodes list if no second parameter provided, it will try to balance all
otherwise, will only print the prefered number of barcodes need to balanced:

./balancer barlen8_mismatch3.txt 24 >barlen8_mismatch3.balanced_top24.txt
